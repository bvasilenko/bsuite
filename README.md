# b

Entry point for the b-* prompt lookup tools. Installs the tools, registers each as a Claude Code skill, Codex AGENTS template, or Cursor rule so the agent loop discovers and invokes them, and updates installed tools on demand.

## One-line install

```sh
npm install -D @booga/b
```

That single line:

- Pulls `b` plus the 6 prompt lookup tools (bground, banchor, bsmell, bratch, bwatch, bspector) onto your machine.
- Auto-registers all 6 with every supported substrate by default: Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor.
- Scope is project-local for a project install (writes to `<project>/.claude/skills/`, `<project>/AGENTS.md`, `<project>/.cursor/rules/`).
- Scope is user-wide for a global install (`npm install -g @booga/b`).

## Opt-out

- Skip the auto-register step entirely: set `B_SKIP_AUTO_INSTALL=1` before `npm install`.
- Skip specific substrates: set `B_SKIP_TARGETS=cursor,codex` before `npm install`.

You can still run the install CLI by hand later:

```sh
b install --target=claude
b install --target=codex
b install --target=cursor
b uninstall --target=claude
```
